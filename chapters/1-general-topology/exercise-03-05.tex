\subsection{}

Let~$A'$ and~$B'$ be two closed subsets of~$U$ with~$U = A' ∪ B'$.
There exist closed subsets~$A$ and~$B$ of~$X$ with~$A' = A ∩ U$ and~$B' = B ∩ U$.
It follows that
\[
	X = A ∪ B ∪ (X - U)
\]
is a cover of~$X$ by closed subsets.
But~$X$ is irreducible.
Thus,~$A = X$,~$B = X$ or~$X - U = X$, i.e.,~$A = X$,~$B = X$ or~$U = ∅$.
We have in either case that~$A' = A ∩ U = U$ or~$B' = B ∩ U = U$.
