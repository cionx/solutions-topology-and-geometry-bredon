\subsection{}

The kernel of~$ϕ$ is a normal subgroup of~$G$ because the map~$ϕ$ is a homomorphism of groups.

The singleton~$\{ e \}$ in~$H$ is closed because~$H$ is a Hausdorff space.
It follows from the continuity of~$ϕ$ that~$K = ϕ^{-1}( \{ e \} )$ is closed in~$G$.

The map~$ϕ$ descends to an isomorphism of groups
\[
	ϕ'
	\colon
	G / K \to H \,,
	\quad
	\class{g} \mapsto ϕ(g)
\]
because~$ϕ$ is surjective.
The map~$ϕ$ is also continuous because~$G / K$ is endowed with the quotient topology induced from~$G$.
If~$G$ is compact then the quotient~$G / K$ is again compact;
and~$H$ is a Hausdorff space.
It then follows that the continuous bijection~$ϕ$ is already a homeomorphism.
