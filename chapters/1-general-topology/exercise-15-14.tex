\begin{lemma}
	\label{closure of symmetric neighbourhood is in square}
	Let~$G$ be a topological group and let~$V$ be a symmetric neighbourhood of the identity.
	Then~$\closure{V} ⊆ V^2$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Let~$x$ be an arbitrary element of the closure~$\closure{V}$.
	The set~$x V$ is a neighbourhood of~$x$ and therefore intersects~$V$.
	There hence exist elements~$v_1$ and~$v_2$ of~$V$ with~$x v_1 = v_2$.
	It follows that
	\[
		x = v_2 v_1^{-1} ⊆ V V^{-1} = V V = V^2 \,.
	\]
	This proves the \lcnamecref{closure of symmetric neighbourhood is in square}.
\end{proof}

We already know that~$G$ is a Hausdorff space, so it suffices to prove for every point~$g$ in~$G$ that the closed neighbourhoods of~$g$ form a neighbourhood basis for~$g$.
In other words, every neighbourhood~$N$ of~$g$ needs to contain a closed neighbourhood.
The translation map~$L_g$ is a homeomorphism with~$L_g(e) = g$, so we may assume that~$g = e$ to begin with.

There exist by Proposition~15.9 a symmetric neighbourhood~$V$ of the identity with~$V^2 ⊆ N$.
It follows from \cref{closure of symmetric neighbourhood is in square} that
\[
	\closure{V}
	⊆
	V^2
	⊆
	N \,.
\]
But~$\closure{V}$ contains~$V$, and is therefore again a neighbourhood of the identity -- this is the desired closed neighbourhood.
