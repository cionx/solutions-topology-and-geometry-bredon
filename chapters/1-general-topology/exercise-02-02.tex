\subsection{}

Let~$T$ be the topology on the real line~$ℝ$ generated by the half-open intervals~$[x, y)$ together with the half-open intervals~$(x, y]$ for arbitrary~$x, y ∈ ℝ$.
We observe for every point~$x$ in~$ℝ$ that the singleton set~$\{ x \}$ can be expressed as
\[
	\{ x \} = (x - 1, x] ∩ [x, x + 1) \,,
\]
and thus as the intersection of two sets belonging to~$T$.
It follows for every~$x ∈ ℝ$ that~$\{ x \}$ belongs to~$T$.
It further follows that every subset~$U$ of~$ℝ$ belongs to~$T$, because~$U$ can be expressed a union of sets belonging to~$T$, namely as
\[
	U = ⋃_{x ∈ U}{} \{ x \} \,.
\]

We have thus shown that every subset of~$ℝ$ belongs to~$T$.
Therefore,~$T$ is the discrete topology on~$ℝ$.
