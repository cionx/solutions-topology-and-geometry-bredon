Let more generally~$X_1, X_2, \dotsc$ be countable many metric spaces.

In the case of finitely many spaces, say~$n$ many, we know from Exercise~I.8.1 (as well as from Exercise~I.8.2) that the topological space~$X_1 × \dotsb × X_n$ is again metrizable.

In the case of infinite countable many spaces we first use Proposition~9.6 to replace for every index~$i$ the metric on~$X_i$ by a metric that is bounded by~$1$ and that induces the same topology on~$X_i$.
We then use Proposition~9.7 to see that~$∏_{i ≥ 1} X_i$ is metrizable.
