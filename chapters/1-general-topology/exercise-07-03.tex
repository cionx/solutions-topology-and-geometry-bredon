\subsection{}

Let~$S$ be an infinite set.

Let~$X$ be~$S$ together with the discrete topology, and let~$Y$ be~$S$ together with the indiscrete topology.
Let~$f \colon X \to Y$ be the identity map, which is continuous.
The fibre~$f^{-1}(s) = \{ s \}$ is finite and thus compact for every~$s ∈ S$.

The space~$X$ is not compact, because the open cover~$X = ⋃_{s ∈ S} {} \{ s \}$ does not admit a finite subcover.
The space~$Y$ is compact because it admits only finitely many open sets.
But~$f^{-1}(Y) = X$, so that~$f$ is not proper.
