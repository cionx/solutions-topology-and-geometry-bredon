Let~$C_1$ and~$C_2$ be two closed subsets of~$X$.
This means that their complements~$X - C_1$ and~$X - C_2$ are open in~$X$.
The complement
\[
	X - (C_1 ∪ C_2)
	=
	(X - C_1) ∩ (X - C_2)
\]
is therefore an intersection of two open subsets of~$X$, and thus again open in~$X$.
This means that the union~$C_1 ∪ C_2$ is closed in~$X$.



\subsection{}

Let~$(C_i)_{i ∈ I}$ be a family of closed subsets of~$X$.
This means that the complement~$X - C_i$ is open in~$X$ for every index~$i ∈ I$.
The complement
\[
	X - ⋂_{i ∈ I} C_i
	=
	⋃{} (X - C_i)
\]
is therefore a union of open subsets of~$X$, and thus again open in~$X$.
This means that the intersection~$⋂_{i ∈ I} C_i$ is closed in~$X$.



\subsection{}

Both the empty set~$∅$ and the entire space~$X$ are open in~$X$, whence their complements~$X - ∅ = X$ and~$X - X = ∅$ are closed in~$X$.
