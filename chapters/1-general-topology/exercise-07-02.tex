Let~$C' ≔ X - U$, for every index~$α$ let~$C'_α ≔ C_α ∩ C'$, and consider the collection of closed sets
\[
	F' ≔ \{ C'_α \suchthat α ∈ A \} \,.
\]
The family~$F'$ is again closed under finite intersections because the original family~$\{ C_α \suchthat α ∈ A \}$ is closed under finite intersections.
But overall we have
\[
	⋂_{α ∈ A} C'_α
	=
	⋂_{α ∈ A} C_α ∩ C'
	=
	C ∩ C'
	⊆
	U ∩ C'
	=
	∅ \,.
\]
It now follows from the compactness of~$X$ that the family~$F'$ does \emph{not} have the finite intersection property.
There hence exists a finite intersection of elements of~$F'$ that is empty.
But~$F'$ is closed under finite intersections, so~$F'$ must already contain the empty set.
This means that for some index~$α$ we have~$C'_α = ∅$, and thus
\[
	∅ = C'_α = C_α ∩ C' = C_α ∩ (X - U) \,.
\]
The equality~$C_α ∩ (X - U) = ∅$ tells us that~$C_α ⊆ U$.
