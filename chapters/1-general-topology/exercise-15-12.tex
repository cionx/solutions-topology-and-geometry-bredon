\subsection{}

We regard~$ℍ^n$ as a right~\vectorspace{$ℍ$}.
This allows us to replace~$\Mat(n, ℍ)$ by~$\End_ℍ(ℍ^n)$, and~$\GL(n, ℍ)$ by~$\GL_ℍ(ℍ^n)$.
We now need to show that~$\GL_ℍ(ℍ^n)$ is open in~$\End_ℍ(ℍ^n)$.

We observe that~$\End_ℍ(ℍ^n)$ is a linear subspace of~$\End_ℝ(ℍ^n)$, and that
\begin{equation}
	\label{quaternion GL via real GL}
	\GL_ℍ(ℍ^n) = \End_ℍ(ℍ^n) ∩ \GL_ℝ(ℍ^n) \,.
\end{equation}
We already know (by the usual determinant argument) that~$\GL_ℝ(V)$ is open in~$\End_ℝ(V)$ for every finite-dimensional~\vectorspace{$ℝ$}~$V$.
This is in particular the case for~$V = ℍ^n$.
It therefore follows from~\eqref{quaternion GL via real GL} that~$\GL_ℍ(ℍ^n)$ is open in~$\End_ℍ(ℍ^n)$.
