\subsection{}

Let~$X$ be a topological space and let~$X'$ be a retract of~$X$.
This means that~$X'$ is a subspace of~$X$, with inclusion map~$i \colon X' \to X$, such that there exists a continuous map~$r \colon X \to X'$ with~$r i = \id_{X'}$.

Suppose that~$X$ is contractible.
This means that there exists a constant map~$c \colon X \to X$ with~$\id_X ≃ c$.
It follows that
\[
	\id_{X'}
	=
	r i
	=
	r \id_X i
	≃
	r c i \,.
\]
The map~$r c i$ is again constant, so we find that~$X'$ is again contractible.
