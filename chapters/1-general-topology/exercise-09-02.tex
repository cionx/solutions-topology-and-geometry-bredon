Let~$X$ be a completely regular space and let~$Y$ be a subspace of~$X$.

Let~$C$ be a closed subset of~$Y$ and let~$y$ be a point in~$Y$ with~$y ∉ C$.
There exists a closed subset~$C'$ of~$X$ with~$C = C' ∩ X$.
It follows from~$y ∉ C$ that also~$y ∉ C'$.
There hence exist a continuous function~$f' \colon X \to ℝ$ with~$\restrict{f'}{C'} ≡ 1$ and~$f'(y) = 0$.
It follows that the restriction~$f ≔ \restrict{f'}{C}$ is a continuous function from~$Y$ to~$ℝ$ with~$\restrict{f}{C} ≡ 1$ and~$f(y) = 0$.

The existence of this function shows that the subspace~$Y$ is again completely regular.
