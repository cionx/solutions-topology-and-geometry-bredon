The groups~$\SUni(0)$ and~$\SUni(1)$ are trivial and therefore connected.

Let~$n ≥ 2$ and suppose that we have already proven~$\SUni(n - 1)$ to be connected.
The quotient~$\SUni(n) / \SUni(n - 1)$ is homeomorphic to~$\sphere^{2n - 1}$ and therefore connected.
It follows from Exercise~I.15.5 that~$\SUni(n)$ is connected.

The group~$\Uni(0)$ is trivial and therefore connected.
For~$n ≥ 1$ we can consider the determinant function
\[
	\det \colon \Uni(n) \to \sphere^1 \,,
\]
which is both continuous and surjective.
Its kernel is given by~$\SUni(n)$, whence it induces a continuous isomorphism of groups
\[
	\det' \colon \Uni(n) / \SUni(n) \to \sphere^1 \,.
\]
The quotient space~$\Uni(n) / \SUni(n)$ is again compact and the sphere~$\sphere^1$ is a Hausdorff space, whence~$\det'$ is already a homeomorphism.
It follows that the quotient space~$\Uni(n) / \SUni(n)$ is connected.
It further follows that~$\Uni(n)$ is connected by Exercise~I.15.5.
