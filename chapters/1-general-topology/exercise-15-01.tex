\subsubsection*{$G_0$ is closed}

The component~$G_0$ is closed because components are always closed.



\subsubsection*{$G_0$ is a subgroup}

The component~$G_0$ contains the neutral element~$e$, by definition.

Let~$g$ be an arbitrary element of~$G_0$.
The left-multiplication map~$L_g \colon G \to G$ is a homeomorphism and therefore permutes the components of~$G_0$.
It follows from~$L_g(e) = g$ that the component of~$e$ is mapped to the component of~$g$, i.e., that~$G_0$ is mapped to~$G_0$.
This shows that~$g G_0 ⊆ G_0$.
As~$g$ is arbitrary in~$G_0$, this shows that~$G_0 G_0 ⊆ G_0$.
The component~$G_0$ is therefore closed under multiplication.

The inversion map~$i \colon G \to G$ is a homeomorphism and therefore permutes the components of~$G_0$.
It follows that the component of~$e$ is mapped to the component of~$i(e) = e^{-1} = e$.
That is,~$i(G_0) = G_0$, so that~$G_0^{-1} = G_0$.
This shows that the component~$G_0$ is closed under inversion.



\subsubsection*{$G_0$ is normal}

Let~$g$ be an arbitrary element of~$G$.
The conjugation map
\[
	c_g
	\colon
	G \to G \,,
	\quad
	x \mapsto g x g^{-1}
\]
is a homeomorphism and therefore permutes the components of~$G$.
It follows from~$c_g(e) = e$ that the component of~$e$ is mapped to the component of~$e$.
In other words,~$c_g(G_0) ⊆ G_0$, so that~$g G_0 g^{-1} ⊆ G_0$.
As~$g$ is arbitrary in~$G$, this shows that~$G_0$ is normal.
