Every projection map~$π_α \colon ∏_β Y_β \to Y_α$ is continuous, so if~$f \colon X \to ∏_β Y_β$ is continuous, then so is every composite~$π_α ∘ f$.

Suppose on the other hand that the composite~$π_α ∘ f ≕ f_α$ is continuous for every index~$α$.
Let~$(x_λ)_{λ ∈ Λ}$ be a net in~$X$ with~$x_λ \to x$ in~$X$.
It follows for every index~$α$ from the continuity of~$f_α$ that
\[
	π_α( f(x_λ) ) = f_α(x_λ) \to f_α(x) = π_α( f(x) ) \,.
\]
It further follows from Proposition~8.8 that already~$f(x_λ) \to f(x)$.
We have thus shown that~$f$ preserves limits of nets, and is therefore continuous.
