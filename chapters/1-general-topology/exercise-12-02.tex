\subsection{}

There exists for every~$x ∈ X$ some open neighbourhood~$U_x$ of~$x$ and some length~$ε_x > 0$ such that
\[
	U_x × [0, ε_x) ⊆ U \,.
\]

The collection~$\cover{U} ≔ \{ U_x \suchthat x ∈ X \}$ is an open cover of~$X$.
There hence exists a partition of unity subordinate to this open cover.
More explicitly, there exists an open cover~$\cover{V}= \{ V_α \suchthat α ∈ A \}$ and continuous functions~$f_α \colon X \to [0, 1]$ for~$α ∈ A$ such that
\begin{itemize*}

	\item
		$\cover{V}$ is locally finite,

	\item
		$\supp(f_α) ⊆ V_α$ for every~$α ∈ A$,

	\item
		$\sum_{α ∈ A} f_α(x) = 1$ for every~$x ∈ X$,

	\item
		$\cover{V}$ is a refinement of~$\cover{U}$:
		more explicitly, there exists for every index~$α ∈ A$ some point~$x ∈ X$ with~$V_α ⊆ U_x$.

\end{itemize*}
It follows from the last point that there exists for every index~$α ∈ A$ some length~$ε_α > 0$ with
\[
	V_α × [0, ε_α) ⊆ U \,.
\]

\begin{claim}
	The function
	\[
		f
		\colon
		X \to [0, 1] \,,
		\quad
		x \mapsto ∑_{α ∈ A} ε_α f_α(x)
	\]
	is again well-defined and continuous.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
	Let~$x$ be an arbitrary point in~$X$.
	There exists by assumption an open neighbourhood~$W$ of~$x$ that intersects only finitely many~$V_α$.
	This entails that only finitely many~$f_α$ are nonzero on~$W$.
	The function~$f$ is therefore well-defined on~$W$.
	Moreover,~$\restrict{f}{W}$ is a linear combination of finitely many continuous functions, and therefore itself continuous.

	This shows that~$f$ is well-defined and locally continuous, and therefore continuous.
\end{proof}

It remains to show that~$(x, y) ∈ U$ whenever~$0 ≤ y ≤ f(x)$.
We fix an arbitrary point~$x$ in~$X$ and need to show that
\[
	\{ x \} × [0, f(x)) ⊆ U \,.
\]

There exist only finitely many indices~$α_1, \dotsc, α_n ∈ A$ with~$x ∈ V_{α_i}$ for every~$i$.
It follows from~$x ∈ V_{α_i}$ that
\[
	\{ x \} × [0, ε_{α_i}) ⊆ U
\]
for every~$i$.
We also find that
\[
	f(x) = ε_{α_1} f_{α_1}(x) + \dotsb + ε_{α_n} f_{α_n}(x) \,,
	\quad
	f_{α_1}(x) + \dotsb + f_{α_n}(x) = 1 \,.
\]
We consider now the length
\[
	ε ≔ \max(ε_1, \dotsc, ε_n) \,.
\]
We find that
\[
	\{ x \} × [0, ε) ⊆ U
\]
and that
\[
	f(x)
	=
	∑_{i = 1}^n ε_{α_i} f_{α_i}(x)
	≤
	∑_{i = 1}^n ε f_{α_i}(x)
	=
	ε ∑_{i = 1}^n f_{α_i}(x)
	=
	ε ⋅ 1
	=
	ε \,.
\]
Therefore,
\[
	\{ x \} × [0, f(x))
	⊆
	\{ x \} × [0, ε)
	⊆
	U \,.
\]
