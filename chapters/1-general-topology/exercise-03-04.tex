\subsection{}

Let~$A$ and~$B$ be two subsets of a topological space~$X$ such that~$A$ is nowhere dense but~$A ∪ B$ is not nowhere dense.
We claim that~$B$ is not nowhere dense.

The open set~$U ≔ \int(\closure{A ∪ B})$ is by assumption nonempty.
We observe that~$U ⊆ \closure{A ∪ B} = \closure{A} ∪ \closure{B}$ but that~$U$ is not contained in~$\closure{A}$ because~$A$ is nowhere dense.
It follows from~$U ⊈ \closure{A}$ that the open set
\[
	V ≔ U ∩ (X - \closure{A})
\]
is nonempty.
But
\[
	V
	=
	U ∩ (X - \closure{A})
	⊆
	(\closure{A} ∪ \closure{B}) ∩ (X - \closure{A})
	=
	(\closure{A} ∪ \closure{B}) - \closure{A}
	⊆
	\closure{B} \,.
\]
This shows that~$\closure{B}$ contains a nonempty open subset of~$X$.
This tells us that~$B$ is not nowhere dense.
