Let~$p$ be the canonical quotient map from~$G$ to~$G / H$.

Let~$d$ be a continuous map from~$G$ to~$\{ 0, 1\}$.
Each coset~$g H$ is homeomorphic to~$H$, and therefore connected.
The map~$d$ is therefore constant on each coset.
It follows that~$d$ factors through a continuous map~$d' \colon G/H \to \{ 0, 1\}$.
The space~$G / H$ is connected, whence~$d'$ is constant.
It follows that~$d = d' p$ is also constant.
