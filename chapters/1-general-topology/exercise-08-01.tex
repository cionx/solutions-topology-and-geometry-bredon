\subsection{}

We denote the given metric by
\[
	\dist_2((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2))
	≔
	\sqrt{ \dist_X(x_1, x_2)^2 + \dist_Y(y_1, y_2)^2 } \,.
\]
We have the inequalities
\[
	\dist_2 ≤ \sqrt{2} \dist_∞
	\quad\text{and}\quad
	\dist_∞ ≤ \dist_2 \,.
\]
It follows from Proposition~1.3 that~$\dist_2$ and~$\dist_∞$ induce the same topology on~$X × Y$, and we have already seen in Exercise~I.8.2 that~$\dist_∞$ induces the product topology.
