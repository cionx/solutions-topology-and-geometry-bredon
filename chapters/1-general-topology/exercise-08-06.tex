\subsubsection*{First solution}

The map
\[
	(f, g)
	\colon
	X \to Y × Y \,,
	\quad
	x \mapsto (f(x), g(x))
\]
is continuous in each coordinate and thus continuous.
The diagonal~$Δ$ in~$Y × Y$ is closed because~$Y$ is a Hausdorff space.
It follows that the set
\[
	\{ x ∈ X \suchthat f(x) = g(x) \}
	=
	(f, g)^{-1}(Δ)
\]
is again closed.



\subsubsection*{Second solution}

Let~$(x_α)_{α ∈ D}$ be a net in~$E ≔ \{ x ∈ X \suchthat f(x) = g(x) \}$ with~$x_α \to x$ for some point~$x$ in~$X$.
Then both~$f(x_α) \to f(x)$ and~$g(x_α) \to g(x)$ by the continuities of~$f$ and~$g$.
We have~$f(x_α) = g(x_α)$ for every index~$α$, whence the two nets~$( f(x_α) )_α$ and~$( g(x_α) )_α$ coincide.
It follows from the uniqueness of limits that their limits also coincide.
That is,~$f(x) = g(x)$.

We have shown that the set~$E$ is closed under limits of nets.
It is therefore closed.
