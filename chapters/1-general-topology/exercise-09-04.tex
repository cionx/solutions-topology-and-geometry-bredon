Let~$X$ be a completely regular topological space.

Let~$C$ be a closed subset of~$X$ and let~$x$ be a point in~$X$ with~$x ∉ C$.
There exist by assumption a continuous function~$f \colon X \to [0, 1]$ with~$\restrict{f}{C} ≡ 1$ and~$f(x) = 0$.
It follows that the preimages
\[
	U ≔ f^{-1}( (1/2, 1] ) \,,
	\quad
	V ≔ f^{-1}( [0, 1/2) )
\]
are disjoint open subsets of~$X$ with~$C ⊆ U$ and~$x ∈ V$.

This shows that~$X$ is regular.
