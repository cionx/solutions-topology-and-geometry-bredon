\subsection{}

The closed subsets of~$X$ are~$X$ and the finite subsets of~$X$.

Suppose that~$C_1$ and~$C_2$ are two proper closed subsets of~$X$.
This means that both~$C_1$ and~$C_2$ are finite.
The union~$C_1 ∪ C_2$ is then again finite, and thus again a proper subset of~$X$.
This shows that~$X$ is irreducible.

Suppose now that
\[
	C_1 ⊇ C_2 ⊇ C_3 ⊇ \dotsb ⊇ C_i ⊇ \dotsb
\]
is an infinite decreasing sequence of closed subsets of~$X$.
We distinguish between two cases:
\begin{itemize*}

	\item
		If~$C_i = X$ for every index~$i$, then the sequence is stable.

	\item
		Otherwise, there exists some index~$j$ for which the set~$C_j$ is finite.
		The sequence
		\[
			C_j ⊇ C_{j + 1} ⊇ C_{j + 2} ⊇ \dotsb
		\]
		does then consist of finite sets, and must therefore stabilize after finitely many steps.

\end{itemize*}
