\subsection{}

The following conditions are equivalent for every topology on a set~$X$:
\begin{align*}
	{}&
	\text{every singleton is closed}
	\\
	\iff{}&
	\text{all finite unions of singletons are closed}
	\\
	\iff{}&
	\text{all finite subsets of~$X$ are closed}
	\\
	\iff{}&
	\text{all complements of finite subsets of~$X$ are open} \,.
\end{align*}
The smallest topology satisfying the first condition is thus the smallest topology satisfying the last condition, which is precisely the cofinite topology.

Suppose now that~$X$ is infinite and endowed with the cofinite topology.
Every two nonempty open subsets of~$X$ are cofinite, whence their intersection is again cofinite.
This entails that this intersection is nonempty, because~$X$ is infinite.
This tells us that no two points in~$X$ can be separated by disjoint open neighbourhoods.
The space~$X$ is therefore not~\Tax{2}.
