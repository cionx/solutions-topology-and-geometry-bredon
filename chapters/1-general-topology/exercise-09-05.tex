\subsection{}

Let~$A$ be an uncountable set and let~$X ≔ ∏_{α ∈ A} {} [0, 1] = [0, 1]^A$.
Suppose that~$X$ were first countable.

Let~$p$ be the point in~$X$ with coordinate~$p_α = 1$ for every~$α ∈ A$.
This point admits by assumption a countable neighbourhood basis~$U_1, U_2, \dotsc$
We may assume that each~$U_i$ is a basis open set, i.e., that
\[
	U_n
	=
	∏_{α ∈ A}
	\begin{cases*}
		U_{n, α} & if~$α ∈ B_n$, \\
		[0, 1]   & otherwise,
	\end{cases*}
\]
where~$B_n$ is a finite subset of~$A$ and each~$U_{n, α}$ is an open neighbourhood of~$1$ in~$[0, 1]$.
We can consider for every index~$β ∈ A$ the basis open set
\[
	V_β
	≔
	∏_{α ∈ A}
	\begin{cases*}
		\bigl( \frac{1}{2}, 1 \bigr] & if~$α = β$, \\
		[0, 1]   & otherwise.
	\end{cases*}
\]
This set is an open neighbourhood of~$p$, and hence contains some~$U_n$.
But this in only possible if~$β \in B_n$ (because otherwise,~$[0, 1]$ would need to be contained in~$(1/2, 1]$).

We have just shown that~$A = ⋃_n B_n$.
But~$A$ is uncountable, whereas~$⋃_n B_n$ is countable -- a contradiction!

\begin{remark}
	We could also reduce this exercise to part~(a) of Exercise~I.8.8:
	\begin{itemize}

		\item
			We first show that products are compatible with subspaces:
			if~$Y_α$ is a subspace of~$X_α$, then the product topology on~$∏_α Y_α$ coincides with the subspace topology inherited from~$∏_α X_α$.
			The uncountable product~$∏_α {} \{ 0, 1 \}$ is therefore a subspace of the product~$∏_α {} [0, 1]$.

		\item
			We then show that subspace of first countable spaces are again first countable.

	\end{itemize}
	We already know from Exercise~I.8.8 that the product~$∏_{α ∈ A} {} \{ 0, 1 \}$ is not first countable, so it then follows that~$∏_{α ∈ A} {} [0, 1]$ is also not first countable.
\end{remark}
