Let~$(x_α)_{α ∈ D}$ be a universal net in set~$X$, and let~$h \colon D' \to D$ be a final function between directed sets.
We need to show that the net~$(x_{h(α')})_{α' ∈ D'}$ is again universal.

Let~$A$ be any subset of~$X$.
The net~$(x_α)_{α ∈ D}$ is either eventually contained in~$A$ or eventually contained in~$X - A$.
We may assume that~$(x_α)_α$ is eventually in~$A$, because otherwise we can switch around the roles of~$A$ of~$X - A$.

We now know that there exists some index~$α ∈ D$ with~$x_β ∈ A$ for every index~$β ≥ α$.
There exists some element~$α'$ in~$D'$ with~$h(β') ≥ α$ for every~$β' ≥ α'$ because the function~$h$ is final.
This implies that~$x_{h(β')} ∈ A$ for every~$β' ≥ α'$, which tells us that the net~$(x_{h(α')})_{α' ∈ D'}$ is eventually contained in~$A$.
