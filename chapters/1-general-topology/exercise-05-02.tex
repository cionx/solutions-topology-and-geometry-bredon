\subsection{}

Let~$X$ be a finite~\spacespace{\Tax{1}}.

Every singleton set~$\{ x \}$ with~$x âˆˆ X$ is closed in~$X$, and every subset of~$X$ is the union of finitely many singletons.
Consequently, every subset of~$X$ is a union of finitely many closed subsets of~$X$, and therefore itself closed in~$X$.

This shows that every subset of~$X$ is closed in~$X$.
The space~$X$ is therefore discrete.
