\subsection{}

The equivalence class of a real number~$x$ with respect to~$∼$ equals~$x + ℚ$.
Each equivalence class is therefore dense in~$ℝ$.

The closed subsets of~$ℝ / {∼}$ correspond bijectively to the saturated closed subsets of~$ℝ$.
Every nonempty saturated subset~$C$ of~$ℝ$ contains an entire equivalence class, and therefore a dense subset of~$ℝ$.
If~$C$ is closed, then it follows that already~$C = ℝ$.
The only saturated closed subsets of~$ℝ$ are therefore~$∅$ and~$ℝ$.
The only closed subsets of~$ℝ / {∼}$ are therefore~$∅$ and~$R / {∼}$.
In other words, the quotient space~$ℝ / {∼}$ is indiscrete.

Each equivalence class with respect to~$∼$ is countable, but~$ℝ$ is uncountable.
There are therefore uncountably many equivalence classes with respect to~$∼$.
