Let~$C$ be an arbitrary closed subset of~$Y$.
The preimage~$(\restrict{f}{A})^{-1}(C)$ is closed in~$A$, and the preimage~$(\restrict{f}{B})^{-1}(C)$ is closed in~$B$.
As~$A$ and~$B$ are closed in~$X$, it follows that both~$(\restrict{f}{A})^{-1}(C)$ and~$(\restrict{f}{B})^{-1}(C)$ are already closed in~$X$.
We note that it follows from the condition~$X = A ∪ B$ that
\[
	f^{-1}(C) = (\restrict{f}{A})^{-1}(C) ∪ (\restrict{f}{B})^{-1}(C) \,.
\]
As both~$(\restrict{f}{A})^{-1}(C)$ and~$(\restrict{f}{B})^{-1}(C)$ are closed in~$X$, it now follows that~$f^{-1}(C)$ is closed in~$X$.

We have shown that preimages of closed subsets of~$Y$ are closed in~$X$.
This means that~$f$ is continuous.
