\begin{lemma}
	\label{classificaion of irreducible hausdorff spaces}
	Every irreducible Hausdorff space is either empty or a singleton.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Let~$X$ be a Hausdorff space containing two distinct points~$y_1$ and~$y_2$.
	There exist disjoint open subsets~$U_1$ and~$U_2$ of~$X$ with~$y_1 ∈ U_1$ and~$y_2 ∈ U_2$.
	It follows that
	\[
		X = (X - U_1) ∪ (X - U_2)
	\]
	with both~$X - U_1$ and~$X - U_2$ being proper closed subsets of~$X$.
	This tells us that~$X$ is reducible.
\end{proof}

Let~$X$ be a Zariski space that is also a Hausdorff space.
There exists a decomposition~$X = X_1 ∪ \dotsb ∪ X_n$ into nonempty, irreducible, closed subsets by Exercise 6 of Section 3.
Each~$X_i$ is again a Hausdorff space, and therefore a singleton by \cref{classificaion of irreducible hausdorff spaces}.
It follows that~$X$ consists of exactly~$n$ points.
