We consider a collection of topological spaces~$X_α$ and the product~$X ≔ ∏_α X_α$.



\subsubsection*{Product of Hausdorff spaces}

Suppose that every~$X_α$ is a Hausdorff space.
Let~$x$ and~$y$ be two distinct points in~$X$.
That~$x$ and~$y$ are distinct means that these two points differ in some coordinate.
In other words, there exists an index~$α$ with~$π_α(x) ≠ π_α(y)$.
There exist disjoint open subsets~$U$ and~$V$ of~$X_α$ with~$π_α(x) ∈ U$ and~$π_α(y) ∈ V$.
The preimages~$π_α^{-1}(U)$ and~$π_α^{-1}(V)$ are disjoint open subsets of~$X$ with~$x ∈ π_α^{-1}(U)$ and~$y ∈ π_α^{-1}(V)$.
The existence of these sets shows that~$X$ is again Hausdorff.



\subsubsection*{Product of regular spaces}

Suppose that every~$X_α$ is regular.

To show that~$X$ is again regular we will show that~$X$ is a Hausdorff space and that for every point~$x$ in~$X$ the closed neighbourhoods of~$x$ form a neighbourhood basis for~$x$.
Every~$X_α$ is a Hausdorff space, and we have already shown that~$X$ is therefore again a Hausdorff space.

Let~$x$ be a point in~$X$ and let~$N$ be a neighbourhood of~$x$.
We need to show that there exists a closed neighbourhood~$C$ of~$x$ with~$C ⊆ N$.
We may assume that~$N$ is an open basis set.
That is,~$N$ is of the form~$∏_α U_α$ for open subsets~$U_α$ of~$X_α$ with~$U_α = X_α$ for all but finitely many indices~$α$.

Each~$U_α$ is then a neighbourhood of~$x_α$ in~$X_α$.
We know that every~$X_α$ is regular, so there exists for every index~$α$ a closed neighbourhood~$C_α$ of~$x_α$ in~$X_α$ with~$C_α ⊆ U_α$.
This closed neighbourhood contains an open neighbourhood~$V_α$.
If~$U_α$ is all of~$X_α$, then we choose both~$C_α$ and~$V_α$ as all of~$V_α$.

The set~$V ≔ ∏_α V_α$ is a basis open set in~$X$ that contains~$x$, and
\[
	C
	≔
	∏_α C_α
	=
	∏_α π_α^{-1}(C_α)
\]
is a closed subset of~$X$.
We have~$V_α ⊆ C_α ⊆ U_α$ for every index~$α$, and thus~$V ⊆ C ⊆ U$.
We have altogether shown that~$C$ is a closed neighbourhood of~$x$ with~$C ⊆ N$.
