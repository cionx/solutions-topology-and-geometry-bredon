Suppose that there exists a net~$(x_α)_{α ∈ D}$ in~$X$ that does not admit a convergent subnet.

According to Proposition 6.10, this means that no point~$y$ in~$X$ is an accumulation point of~$(x_α)_{α ∈ D}$.
In other words, there exists for every point~$y$ in~$X$ a neighbourhood~$U_y$ of~$y$ such that~$(x_α)_{α ∈ D}$ is not frequent in~$U_y$ -- this in turn means that there exists some index~$α_y$ with~$β \notin U_y$ for every~$β ≥ α_y$.

We may assume that each neighbourhood~$U_y$ is open.
The sets~$U_y$ for an open cover of~$X$, which admits an open subcover by the compactness of~$X$.
There hence exist points~$y_1, \dotsc, y_n$ in~$X$ with
\[
	X = U_{y_1} ∪ \dotsb ∪ U_{y_n} \,.
\]

There exists an index~$α$ with~$α ≥ α_{y_1}, \dotsc, α_{y_n}$ because~$D$ is directed.
We have~$x_β ∉ X$ for every~$β ≥ α$, an absurdity.
