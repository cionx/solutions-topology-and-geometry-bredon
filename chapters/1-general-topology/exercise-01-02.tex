\subsection{}

We have for any two points~$x$ and~$y$ in~$X$ the two inequalities
\[
	\dist(x, x_0)
	≤
	\dist(x, y) + \dist(y, x_0)
\]
and
\[
	\dist(y, x_0)
	≤
	\dist(y, x) + \dist(x, x_0)
	=
	\dist(x, y) + \dist(x, x_0) \,,
\]
and therefore the two equalities
\[
	\dist(x, x_0) - \dist(y, x_0)
	≤
	\dist(x, y) \,,
\]
and
\[
	-( \dist(x, x_0) - \dist(y, x_0) )
	=
	\dist(y, x_0) - \dist(x, x_0)
	≤
	\dist(x, y) \,.
\]
This means that
\[
	\abs{ \dist(x, x_0) - \dist(y, x_0) }
	≤
	\dist(x, y) \,.
\]
The function~$\dist(\ph, x_0)$ is therefore Lipschitz continuous (with Lipschitz constant~$1$), and hence continuous.
